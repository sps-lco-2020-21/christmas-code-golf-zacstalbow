# Christmas Challenge - Code Golf 

Write a program to print out the carol ["The Twelve days of Christmas"](https://www.christmas-carols.net/carols/twelve-days.html) for each and every one of the twelve days. 

Your program should print out all twelve days, *in full including accurate punctuation*, please! 

You should look to use iteration, probably a list or two, maybe some conditional statements too. 

**Bonus**: a prize (in the New Year) for the shortest working code, i.e. the source code file using the fewest characters. And, for the avoidance of doubt, putting them in a text file is cheating!!

Can you get it working before tomorrow's lesson?!
